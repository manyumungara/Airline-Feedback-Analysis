Airline-Feedback-Analysis
Analysis of airline customer reviews to identify sentiment trends and common support-related issues. Includes data visualizations and insights using NLP techniques.
To improve service and satisfy passenger requirements, airlines need to know about customer actions. With the advent of online reviews and booking records, this knowledge can now be used by airlines to look at this information and find out what passengers are looking for. Using Python tools for Big Data evaluation, this work processes and explores customer reviews and booking reports.

In January, the travel experience rating is around 3.0. 
February is the best month to be in the city with travel experiences reaching 3.5 on the daily. 
From March to June the travel experiences show a less enjoyable rating from 2.5 to a 3.0. 
July and August show a slight increase in the ratings on travel experiences. 
September and October are also great months for travel with travel experience ratings almost reaching 3.5. 
In November and December, the travel experiences show a decrease on the rating back to around 3.0. 
So, in conclusion February, September, and October are the best months to travel weeks that would be the best way to spend holidays, and March to June does not look like favorable to travel.

Economy Class is the most common, followed by Business Class, Premium Economy, and First Class in that order. This distribution is typical in airline travel, where the majority of passengers travel in economy due to cost considerations.

●	Economy Class:  Since many passengers are traveling for leisure, airlines could enhance entertainment options such as movies, music, and games that cater to a wide variety of tastes.
●	Business Class: Although a considerable portion of the passengers are still business travelers, there are quite a few solo and couple travelers. Fewer families are seen in this class. Families are less common in this class. Amenities such as USB ports, power outlets and free Wi-Fi should be available at every seat to assist business travelers in staying productive on the flight.
●	Premium Economy: Similar to Economy, but with slightly more business travelers and fewer families.
●	First Class: This class has a balanced mix of all types of travelers, but like the other classes, solo and couple travelers are more common than families.
